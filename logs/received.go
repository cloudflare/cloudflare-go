// The `/received` api route allows customers to retrieve their edge HTTP logs. The

// the minute M refers to the time records were received at Cloudflare's central
// data center. `start` is inclusive, and `end` is exclusive. Because of that, to
// get all data, at minutely cadence, starting at 10AM, the proper values are:
// `start=2018-05-20T10:00:00Z&end=2018-05-20T10:01:00Z`, then
// `start=2018-05-20T10:01:00Z&end=2018-05-20T10:02:00Z` and so on; the overlap

	// requests. `count` must be an integer > 0.
	Count param.Field[int64] `query:"count"`
	// The `/received` route by default returns a limited set of fields, and allows
	// customers to override the default field set by specifying individual fields. The
	// reasons for this are: 1. Most customers require only a small subset of fields,
	// but that subset varies from customer to customer; 2. Flat schema is much easier
	// to work with downstream (importing into BigTable etc); 3. Performance (time to
	// process, file size). If `?fields=` is not specified, default field set is
	// returned. This default field set may change at any time. When `?fields=` is
	// provided, each record is returned with the specified fields. `fields` must be
	// specified as a comma separated list without any whitespaces, and all fields must
	// exist. The order in which fields are specified does not matter, and the order of
	// fields in the response is not specified.
	Fields param.Field[string] `query:"fields"`
	// When `?sample=` is provided, a sample of matching records is returned. If
	// `sample=0.1` then 10% of records will be returned. Sampling is random: repeated
	// calls will not only return different records, but likely will also vary slightly
	// in number of returned records. When `?count=` is also specified, `count` is
	// applied to the number of returned records, not the sampled records. So, with
	// `sample=0.05` and `count=7`, when there is a total of 100 records available,
	// approximately five will be returned. When there are 1000 records, seven will be
	// returned. When there are 10,000 records, seven will be returned.

	// timestamp (in seconds or nanoseconds), or an absolute timestamp that conforms to

	// than seven days.
	Start param.Field[ReceivedGetParamsStartUnion] `query:"start"`
	// By default, timestamps in responses are returned as Unix nanosecond integers.
	// The `?timestamps=` argument can be set to change the format in which response
	// timestamps are returned. Possible values are: `unix`, `unixnano`, `rfc3339`.
