// get all data, at minutely cadence, starting at 10AM, the proper values are:
// `start=2018-05-20T10:00:00Z&end=2018-05-20T10:01:00Z`, then
// `start=2018-05-20T10:01:00Z&end=2018-05-20T10:02:00Z` and so on; the overlap

Count param.Field[int64] `query:"count"`
// The `/received` route by default returns a limited set of fields, and allows
// customers to override the default field set by specifying individual fields. The
// reasons for this are: 1. Most customers require only a small subset of fields,
// but that subset varies from customer to customer; 2. Flat schema is much easier
// to work with downstream (importing into BigTable etc); 3. Performance (time to
// process, file size). If `?fields=` is not specified, default field set is
// returned. This default field set may change at any time. When `?fields=` is
// provided, each record is returned with the specified fields. `fields` must be
// specified as a comma separated list without any whitespaces, and all fields must
// exist. The order in which fields are specified does not matter, and the order of
// fields in the response is not specified.
Fields param.Field[string] `query:"fields"`
// When `?sample=` is provided, a sample of matching records is returned. If
// `sample=0.1` then 10% of records will be returned. Sampling is random: repeated
// calls will not only return different records, but likely will also vary slightly
// in number of returned records. When `?count=` is also specified, `count` is
// applied to the number of returned records, not the sampled records. So, with
// `sample=0.05` and `count=7`, when there is a total of 100 records available,
// approximately five will be returned. When there are 1000 records, seven will be
// returned. When there are 10,000 records, seven will be returned.

// timestamp (in seconds or nanoseconds), or an absolute timestamp that conforms to

// The `?timestamps=` argument can be set to change the format in which response
// timestamps are returned. Possible values are: `unix`, `unixnano`, `rfc3339`.
