## Setting up the environment

### Install Go 1.18+

Install go by following relevant directions [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Modifying/Adding code

Most of the SDK is generated code. Modifications to code will be persisted between generations, but may
result in merge conflicts between manual patches and changes from the generator. The generator will never
modify the contents of the `lib/` and `examples/` directories.

## Adding and running examples

All files in the `examples/` directory are not modified by the generator and can be freely edited or added to.

```bash
# add an example to examples/<your-example>/main.go

package main

func main() {
  // ...
}
```

```bash
go run ./examples/<your-example>
```

## Using the repository from source

To use a local version of this library from source in another project, edit the `go.mod` with a replace
directive. This can be done through the CLI with the following:

```bash
go mod edit -replace github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/v2=/path/to/cloudflare-go
```

## Running tests

Most tests require you to [set up a mock server](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism) against the OpenAPI spec to run the tests.

```bash
# you will need npm installed
npx prism mock path/to/your/openapi.yml
```

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Formatting

This library uses the standard gofmt code formatter:

```bash
gofmt -s -w .
```
